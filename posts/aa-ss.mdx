    Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of
    classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.

If installation is successfull it will give version of the git.

## Configure Git

Now let Git know who you are. This is important for version control systems, as each Git commit uses this information:

```bash
git config --global [user.name](http://user.name/) "NAME"
git config --global user.email "EMAIL"
```

## Creating Git Directory/Folder

Let's create a new folder with name demo for our project:

```bash
mkdir demo
cd demo
ls
```


As we can see the demo directory is empty.

## Initialize Git

Once we have navigated to the demo folder, now we can initialize Git in this folder:

```bash
git init 
```


Git creates a hidden folder `.git` to keep track of the changes. 

It is a hidden folder hence we used `ls -a` command to see it

## Initialize Git

Let’s make some changes in this newly intialized repository!!


Hence we created a file demo.txt and added text “Hello World” in it.

## Check Git Status

 `git status`  command shows us the current state of our files in a Git project, telling us if we have made any changes, if there are files ready to be saved, and if there are new files that Git hasn’t started tracking yet.
