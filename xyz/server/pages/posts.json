Linux is an open-source operating system known for its stability, security, and flexibility. It’s widely used in servers, desktops, and embedded systems.</p><p>• <strong>Shells:</strong> A shell is a command-line interface (CLI) that allows users to interact with the operating system. Common shells include Bash (Bourne Again Shell), Zsh, and Fish. Shells interpret user commands and execute them.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Running a command in the Bash shell:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">echo \"Hello, Linux!\"\n\n</code></pre><p><strong>Output:</strong></p><pre><code>Hello, Linux!\n\n</code></pre><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This command uses the Bash shell to output the text \"Hello, Linux!\" to the terminal.</p><h3 id=\"2-man-command\">2. <strong><code>man</code> Command</strong></h3><p><strong>Purpose:</strong> The man (manual) command provides detailed documentation for Linux commands and programs.</p><p><strong>Usage:</strong> To access a command’s manual, type man followed by the command name (e.g., man ls). Within the man pages, you can navigate using arrow keys, search using /, and exit with q.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Viewing the manual page for the <code>ls</code> command:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">man ls\n\n</code></pre><p><strong>Output:</strong></p><pre><code>LS(1)                        User Commands                       LS(1)\n\nNAME\n     ls - list directory contents\n\nSYNOPSIS\n     ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     List information about the FILEs (the current directory by default).\n</code></pre><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This output shows the beginning of the manual page for <code>ls</code>.
