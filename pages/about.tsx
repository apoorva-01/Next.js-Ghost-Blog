                  Hey there! Iâ€™m excited to share my DevOps journey with you ðŸš€ <br /><br />
                  Iâ€™ve been diving into the world of DevOps, learning the ins and outs of making development and operations work better together. <br />

                  <b>Along the way, Iâ€™ve picked up some cool tips, tricks, and a few lessons learned the hard wayâ€”So why not share them? ðŸ˜‰</b>
                </p>
              </span>
              <Image
                src={siteConfig?.authorImage}
                alt={siteConfig?.authorName}
                width={300}
                height={300}
                  className="about-image"
              />
            </div>
            <p>
              As a professional immersed in DevOps, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work with cutting-edge technologies like Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), Jenkins, Docker, and more. <br /><br />
              My blog is a reflection of the knowledge Iâ€™ve gained through hands-on projects, certifications, and real-world challenges.
            </p>

            <p>
              Iâ€™ve been playing around with tools like Jenkins, Docker, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), and Iâ€™m constantly exploring new ways to make things run smoother and faster. <br /><br />
              This blog is my space to jot down everything Iâ€™m learning, from the basics to the more advanced stuff, in the hopes that it might help someone else out there.

            </p>
            <p>

              Whether youâ€™re just getting started with DevOps or youâ€™ve been at it for a while, Iâ€™m glad youâ€™re here. <br />
              Letâ€™s learn, experiment, and maybe even mess up a littleâ€”because thatâ€™s how we grow, right?
